Overview
********

This library provides access to hardware and software locks for use in concurrent C programs. In
general it is not safe to use these to marshall within XC due to the assumptions XC makes about
safe concurrent data access.

Features

  * Hardware locks: fast and power efficient but there are a limited number per tile
  * Software locks: slower but an unlimited number can be used
